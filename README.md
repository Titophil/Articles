# Articles
Articles Management System
Overview
This Python project manages authors, articles, and magazines using a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite). It provides ORM-like classes to interact with the database, including creating, reading, updating, and querying authors, magazines, and articles.

Features
Add authors, articles, and magazines

Query articles by author or magazine

Track author contributions and magazine categories

Run atomic transactions (e.g., add author with multiple articles)

Schema creation and initial data seeding scripts

Setup Instructions
Requirements
Python 3.8+

PostgreSQL or SQLite (adjust connection in db/connection.py)

psycopg2 or sqlite3 Python packages depending on your DB

Install dependencies (example with pip)
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install psycopg2-binary
Configure your database connection
Edit db/connection.py to set your database credentials and connection parameters.

How to Use
Set up the database schema and seed initial data:

bash
Copy
Edit
python setup_db.py
Run tests to verify everything works:

bash
Copy
Edit
python test_all.py
Use the models to interact with the database in your scripts:

python
Copy
Edit
from lib.models.author import Author

author = Author(name="John Doe")
author.save()

articles = author.articles()
print(articles)
Running Queries
You can also run predefined queries or scripts located in scripts/run_queries.py.
